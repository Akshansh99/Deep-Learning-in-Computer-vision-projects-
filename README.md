# Computer-Vision-Projects-Academic-as-well-as-independent
This repo contains all the computer vision projects that i have done for completion of the academic courses as well as for fun. 
The following projects along with their description are in this repository :

1. Hand Signs Images Classification : Dataset- Pictures of Hand Gestures showing digits from 1 to 5. Objective - To recognise digits from the images of hand signs
How : Used Convolutional Network Architecture and AdamOptimizer with minibatches. Technologies : Tensorflow, pandas, image library of python
Academic project completed during deeplearning.ai course. 

2. Happy House Project : Dataset - Pictures of faces of people. Goal was to classify faces in two categories : happy and unhappy. if network says happy then only the person will
be allowed to enter the house. Used Convonet Architecture implemented with Keras framework.

3. Dog Breed Classification : This is a featured competition at Kaggle. I participated in that competition and contributed this project. Implemented pretrained vgg19 neural network architecture for prediction of 120 breed classes. 

4. Resnet Implementation : Implemented Residual Network Architecture using Keras and Tensorflow
